# 🍳 Daddy Green Cooking Recipe – Landing & Registration Page

This is a static frontend project created in 2017 during my school days. The project was my **first impression and experiment with HTML and CSS**, focusing on building a visually appealing cooking recipe website landing page and a user registration page.

## 🌱 About the Project

**Daddy Green Cooking Recipe** is a basic recipe-sharing web concept featuring:

- A homepage with a hero section, recipe teasers, and branding
- A registration page for new users to sign up (UI only, no backend)
- Styled purely with HTML and CSS (no JavaScript or frameworks)
- Designed as part of my self-learning journey into frontend development
